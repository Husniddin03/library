                        <p>In 2022, I became a first-year student at the Samarkand branch of the Tashkent University of Information Technologies. At that time, the only things I truly loved and understood were mathematics and a bit of physics — those were the subjects that sparked my interest and shaped my early academic path.</p>

                        <p>Now, in 2025, I am a third-year student at the same university. Over the past few years, I’ve learned the fundamentals of several programming languages. What was once just curiosity has now become my passion — programming has turned into the meaning of my life, the foundation of my dreams, and the source of my daily motivation.</p>
